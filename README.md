Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room CLient wanted to create a program that would run on multipul platforms. They wanted to design a program that 
would support multipul players at one time and be able to run several game instances so that mutipul games could run at once.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I feel that the actual coding portion was particular easier for me and made more sense. I feel that the exeutive summary and software design document was more challenging to me

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I feel that the domain model and evaluations was most helpful for developing the code. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would choose the recomendations portion to revise. i would add more information and detail. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
most of teh code wa already done. i just filled in the blanks. when developing the code. i dont think i really understood the users needs, besides them needing to join a team, create a team, or a user name. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
Alot of the technique and stratigeis i used was from the book i took exact examples and reused the code to mirror the already designed application. I think i could find other stratigies by watching more videos and seeing if there are other ways to do the same thing.
